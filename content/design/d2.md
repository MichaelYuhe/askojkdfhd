This template produces minimalist academic papers with LaTeX. [This paper](/d2.pdf) illustrates the output of the template. 

## Download

- [paper.tex](/paper.tex) --  Skeleton for the paper. Fill it out with the content of your paper. By compiling `paper.tex` you obtain [this PDF file](/d2.pdf).
- [paper.sty](/paper.sty) --  LaTeX style file collecting all the formatting commands. Must be included in the same folder as `paper.tex`.
- [bibliography.bst](/bibliography.bst) -- LaTeX style file to format academic bibliographies. Must be included in the same folder as `paper.tex`. The style file is based on the style file `econ.bst`, which was created by [Shiro Takeda](https://shirotakeda.github.io) and is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ShiroTakeda/econ-bst).

## Additional files for online appendix

The repository also includes an additional template and style file in case the appendix of the paper must be carved out into a separate online appendix. [This appendix](/d2a.pdf) illustrates the output of the template.

- [appendix.tex](/appendix.tex) –  Skeleton of the online appendix. Fill it out with the content of your online appendix. The appendix must be in the same folder as the paper so the equation and section labels from the paper can be used in the online appendix.  By compiling `appendix.tex` you obtain [this PDF file](/d2a.pdf).
- [appendix.sty](/appendix.sty) –  LaTeX style file collecting additional formatting commands for the online appendix. Must be included in the same folder as `appendix.tex`. This style file must be used in conjunction with `paper.sty`, which must also be included in the folder. 

## Key features

- The font for text, roman math, and numbers is [Source Serif Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+Pro).
- The font for Greek and calligraphic math is [Euler](http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-26139.html).
- No colors are used in the text (only black) to reduce distraction, and so papers print well. Colors are reserved for graphs.
- Margins, spacing, and font size are set for comfortable reading.
- Headings are designed so the paper is easy to scan.
- Formatting is also specified for appendix and online appendix.
